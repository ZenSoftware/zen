repo ZenSoftware/Zen\n&#x1F939; Currently under development - New contributors are welcome!&#x1F331;\n&#x1F367; You may open a git issue if you are interested in contributing! &#x1F370;\n\nGraphQL Ambitions\n\n Nest GraphQL resolvers as a gateway to Prisma Client.\n Prisma Case Insensitive Filtering For case-insensitive querying of text.\n PrismaSelect to solve the N+1 problem for all queries for free.\n PrismaDelete to add CASCADE and SET_NULL deletion capabilities to Prisma. These features have yet to be implemented by the core Prisma team.  This project will convert to the approach directly supported by Prisma when the official feature becomes available.\n Nest GraphQL SDL generation to enable auto-completion using a tool like Apollo extension for VS Code\n Code generation of apollo-angular services to enable simple, type safe access to the GraphQL API within Angular. &#x1F380;\n An Angular GraphQLModule to simplify the configuration of the ApolloClient to enable/disable the varying ApolloLink features.\n HttpBatchLink for batching several GraphQL requests that occur within a short debounce interval. This really helps to alleviate network congestion.\n UploadLink to give ApolloClient HTTP multi-part form requests capabilities.  Enabling the uploading of files via GraphQLUpload.\n WebSocketLink for GraphQL subscriptions over websockets.\n\n\nAPI Authentication, Performance & Scaling Ambitions\n\n Nest authentication integration, user creation, and login system designed specifically to work for an Angular SPA (single page application).  This project will provide responsive, \"mobile first\" interfaces for the standard set of authentication features (sign up, login, password change).  \n Angular route guards and Angular directives to show/hide content depending on user permissions.\n Nest authorization directives for server side role-based access control to allow for declarative, fine grained security control over all GraphQL queries and mutations.\n 100% stateless web server authentication via JWT (Javascript Web Tokens). Keeping the API stateless will enable horizontal scaling of container replicas of the api in production.\n\n\nModern Web Components and Styling Ambitions\n\n SASS chosen as the css transpiler of choice\n Angular Material components & theme.\n Directly import Bootstrap reset, utilities, & grid features through SASS imports, and exclude the Bootstrap theme and component styles. These features are missing from Angular Material, and greatly simplify the creation of responsive, mobile first applications.\n\n\nProject & Dev Tools Ambitions\n\n Nx for project management to allow for the use of Nx Console extensions for VSCode.  Nx Console is a GUI interface for monorepos that adds a lot of modern developer conveniences.  It also helps to simplify the use of the various Angular & Nest code generation schematics available in the ecosystem.\n Angular Language Service for VSCode for modern IDE tooling.\n NPM scripts for versioned releases of the api server as a containerized Docker image.  node:14-alpine is used as the Docker container base image, and the appropriate tsconfig.app.json configurations are being applied for the Node v14 Nest app.\n Enforced code formatting via Prettier & import-sort, guaranteeing all contributions to the project are standardized with predictable structure, and clear legibility.\n Compodoc to generate Nest & Angular documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n
